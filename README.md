# 🌐 Suryanshi Singh | Personal Landing Page

Welcome to my minimal, responsive personal landing page!  
Showcasing my journey as a Full Stack developer, this site is built with pure HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript for smooth animations.

## 🚀 Features

  Displays my name as a simple logo, perfectly aligned and spaced.

- **Hero Section:**  
  Tagline and subheading centered with Flexbox.  
  _“Building my Full Stack journey publicly.”_  
  _“Follow along as I learn, build, and deploy projects.”_

  Email contact and social icons (GitHub, LinkedIn) using Font Awesome.  
  Clean background and centered layout.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Looks great on mobile and desktop.  
  Font sizes and padding adjust for smaller screens.
